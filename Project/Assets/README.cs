/*
 * README:
 * All testing should be done from ExperimentalTesting.unity.
 * All the production code to work on will be in Model/Ship and its subdirectories.
 * When each test script can compile, add it to the GameObject Tester.
 * Then run the game and see if you get any exceptions.
 * If you do, track it down to the specific test case that broke your code,
 * and fix it.
 * If it looks like there's a mistake in the test code, then let me know.
